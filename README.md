# Productivity-Watch
Productivity Watch is an open source software designed to monitor and record the duration of time users spend on various applications while running on a Windows system. This tool captures application usage data discreetly and compiles it into insightful reports for users. 
Productivity Watch is developed by me only and I don't consider myself an expert at designing software, so if you want to contribute to this project feel free to do so. I am going to improve this software and introduce new features. 
This is a standalone software, it does not need any web browser or internet connection to function and uses the Win32 API and other open source libraries. **It does not share the data it records locally.**

## Donate
If you like the software and would like to support me in making this and more helpful software, you should consider donating if you can. This money will be used to further develop this software as it would encourage me more. I also want to be an independent developer, and I am also looking forward to making games.
