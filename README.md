# Productivity-Watch
Productivity Watch is an open source software designed to monitor and record the duration of time users spend on various applications while running on a Windows system. This tool captures application usage data discreetly and compiles it into insightful reports for users. 
Productivity Watch is developed by me only and I don't consider myself an expert at designing software, so if you want to contribute to this project feel free to do so. I am going to improve this software and introduce new features. 
This is a standalone software, it does not need any web browser or internet connection to function and uses the Win32 API and other open source libraries. **It does not share the data it records locally.**


## Libraries-used
- imgui
- glfw
- implot
- nlohmann json

## Features to be added
- Let the user set time limits to certain apps and productivity watch will automatically close the apps after it sends a notification to the user.
- Display the usage of a set of apps over a date range.
- Detect whether the user is idle (away from mouse or keyboard).
